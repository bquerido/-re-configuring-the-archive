# -re-configuring-the-archive
Re)configuring the Archive explores possibilities for presenting and interacting with the contents of the archive through the development of dynamic and explorable visualizations. Starting from an exploratory research around the structure of the digital archive, its data, metadata, and algorithmic management, the project aims at the implementation of different modes of content visualization. In particular, it focuses on their applicability to different databases of varying length and complexity.
