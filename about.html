        <p class="paragraph">Archiving implies practices of storage and organization of contents that aim at their revisitation and consultation, as a process of memory reconstruction. With the digitization of the archive, these processes include software-based data manipulation and visualization, enabling malleable and changeable configurations of the archive, and imprinting a new elasticity to the ways of visualizing and exploring its contents. </p>
      
      <p class="paragraph"><em>(Re)configuring the Archive</em> explores possibilities for presenting and interacting with the contents of the archive through the development of dynamic and explorable visualizations. Starting from an exploratory research around the structure of the digital archive, its data, metadata, and algorithmic management, the project aims at the implementation of different modes of content visualization. In particular, it focuses on their applicability to different databases of varying length and complexity.</p>
      
      <p class="paragraph">Developed as an experimental exercise on presentating academic production in communication design, <em>(Re)configuring the Archive</em> contrasts the visualization of contents through a relational network with a visualization of thematic clusters organized by keywords. These visualization modes seek to highlight the relationships between project typologies and reveal their conceptual affinities. In this manner, it seeks to encourage an exploration of the content of the archive, encouraging new readings and associations through visualization.</p>
